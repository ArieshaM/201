    <h1>I am a world changer!</h1>

    <h2> 
        <p>My name is Ariesha Murray. I currently live in Oklahoma City, OK
        with my husband, our 5 children, and my mom. My education consists of
        a BS in Biology, A MS in Divinity, A Doctorate in Ministry, and I
        am currently pursuing a MS in Rehabilitation Counseling and Coding
        training from Code Fellows. I am a grateful believer in Jesus Christ
        and while I do not force my beliefs on anyone, He is a major part
        of the who, what, where, when, why, and how of my life. I love to travel
        in fact, this year I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to 
        3 different states that I had never been to before.
        <p>

        <p>I have spent the last five years as an 8th grade science teacher and
            I am ready for a change. I love teenagers, but I really wanted to have
            more flexibility in my schedule and the ability to be at home with my
            family. 
        </p>

        <p>I have many goals. But my main two are to finish my training at Code Fellows
            and continue to grow every day.
        </p>
